# Transposition Interview Challenge Solution

### Description
This is the solution to the transposition coding challenge using a deque

### Problem Statement
Transposition
A Transposition Error is when two letters are swapped, such as in "hte" instead of "the", or "rign" instead of "ring".
Given a string of characters, can you fix every place where "gn"  appears so it becomes "ng" instead? If there are multiple "g"s in a row,  the "n" should be swapped with the first "g". No "gn" should appear in  the final text, so be careful with all possibilities!

### Full Credit

Try to solve this challenge with only one pass through the text.

Examples

The following are 3 test cases:

* puts transpose('he was searchign on Bign for signign kigns')
> => he was searching on Bing for singing kings

* puts transpose('rignadingdiggn!')
> => ringadingdingg!

* puts transpose('gngngnnggnngggnnn')
> => nnnnnnnnngggggggg
